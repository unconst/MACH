    "question": "Geoff and Trevor each roll a standard, six-sided die. What is the probability that the resulting product of their individual die rolls is an even number?",
    "solution": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Identify all the possible outcomes when Geoff and Trevor each roll a six-sided die.\n2. Determine the conditions under which the product of their rolls is even.\n3. Calculate the probability based on the favorable outcomes.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Possible Outcomes:**\n   Each die roll has 6 possible outcomes (1 through 6). Therefore, rolling two dice (one by Geoff and one by Trevor) has a total of \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) possible outcomes.\n\n2. **Conditions for an Even Product:**\n   The product of two numbers is even if at least one of the numbers is even. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. The odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5.\n\n3. **Calculate Favorable Outcomes:**\n   To count the favorable outcomes where the product is even:\n   - If Geoff rolls an even number (2, 4, 6), the product will be even regardless of Trevor's roll (6 possibilities for each of Geoff's 3 even rolls).\n   - If Geoff rolls an odd number (1, 3, 5), the product is even only if Trevor rolls an even number (3 possibilities for each of Geoff's 3 odd rolls).\n\nNow let's use Python to simulate all possible rolls and count how many of them result in an even product. We'll then calculate the probability.\n```python\n# Define all the possible outcomes for Geoff and Trevor's rolls\noutcomes = [(g, t) for g in range(1, 7) for t in range(1, 7)]\n\n# Initialize count for favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate through all possible outcomes\nfor (g, t) in outcomes:\n    if (g * t) % 2 == 0:\n        favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Probability calculation\ntotal_outcomes = len(outcomes)\nprobability_even_product = favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes\n\nprint(probability_even_product)\n```\n```output\n0.75\n```\nThe probability that the product of the numbers rolled by Geoff and Trevor is even is \\(\\boxed{0.75}\\)."

We need to determine if it is possible to pair each boy with a girl such that the resulting pairs form non-intersecting line segments in a circle.\n\nLet's break the problem down:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**:\n   - Represent each boy and girl as a node in a bipartite graph.\n   - Draw an edge between each boy and each girl he can be paired with.\n\n2. **Perfect Matching**:\n   - Check if there exists a perfect matching in this bipartite graph.

For the line segments to be non-intersecting in a circle, the sequence of pairing must be possible without any two edges crossing.\n\n4. **Circular Permutation**:\n   - In a circle, if we traverse, then the boys and girls have to alternate.
