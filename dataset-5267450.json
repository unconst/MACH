  "question": "Anya possesses a quantity of erasers that is exactly four times the number held by her classmate, Andrea.  If Andrea is currently holding 4 erasers, what is the excess number of erasers Anya has over Andrea?",
  "answer": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of erasers Anya has, given that she has 4 times as many erasers as Andrea. Then, we need to find out how many more erasers Anya has compared to Andrea.\n\nSteps:\n1. Calculate the number of erasers Anya has.\n2. Compute the difference between the number of erasers Anya has and the number of erasers Andrea has.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( E_A \\) as the number of erasers Andrea has.\n- \\( E_N \\) as the number of erasers Anya has.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( E_A = 4 \\) (Andrea has 4 erasers)\n- \\( E_N = 4 \\times E_A \\) (Anya has 4 times as many erasers as Andrea)\n\nThe number of additional erasers Anya has compared to Andrea is \\( E_N - E_A \\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python.\n```python\n# Given number of erasers Andrea has\r\nE_A = 4\r\n\r\n# Number of erasers Anya has, since she has 4 times as many as Andrea\r\nE_N = 4 * E_A\r\n\r\n# Difference between the number of erasers Anya and Andrea have\r\ndifference = E_N - E_A\r\nprint(difference)\n```\n```output\n12\n```\nThe number of erasers Anya has compared to Andrea is 12 more. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]"
